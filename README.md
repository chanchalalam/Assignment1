# Object and Sub-Object Detection System

## Overview

This project is a computer vision system for detecting objects and their associated sub-objects in a hierarchical structure. It processes video streams in real-time, outputs results in JSON format, and allows retrieval of cropped images for detected objects and sub-objects. The system is optimized for CPU inference to achieve real-time performance.

## Features

Hierarchical Detection: Objects and associated sub-objects with unique IDs.

JSON Output: Outputs detection in structured format.

Image Saving: Cropped images of objects and sub-objects.

Real-Time: Optimized for 10â€“30 FPS on CPU.


## Requirements

Python 3.8+

Required Libraries:

ultralytics,opencv-python,numpy

## How to Run the System

1. Clone the Repository: git clone <repository-url>, cd <repository-folder>

2. Prepare Input Video: Place your input video in the videos/ directory. Update the video path in main.py: cap = cv2.VideoCapture("videos/people.mp4")
   
3. Run the System: Execute the main script: python main.py
   
4. View Outputs: JSON results are saved in output.json. Cropped images are saved in the output_images/ directory.
